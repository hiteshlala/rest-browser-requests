# REST Requests

Exploring each of the REST requests from a browser.

GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE requests are made from a browser to a KOA backend.

The server is built to serve this page and is not RESTful.  You would need a DB to make it RESTful - overkill for this exercise.

The requests are written using XMLHttpRequest a technology supported natively by all browsers.  The methods are included in a script tag in the html.

A simple explanation of REST and the main methods [here](https://spring.io/understanding/REST).
